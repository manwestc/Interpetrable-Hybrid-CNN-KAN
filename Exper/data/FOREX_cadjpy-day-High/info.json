Realistic trade strategies can only be applied to predictions on 'Close'-attributes (also available).\n# Attributes \n`Timestamp`: The time of the current data point (Europe/Amsterdam)\n`Bid_Open`: The bid price at the start of this time interval\n`Bid_High`: The highest bid price during this time interval\n`Bid_Low`: The lowest bid price during this time interval\n`Bid_Close`: The bid price at the end of this time interval\n`Bid_Volume`: The number of times the Bid Price changed within this time interval\n`Ask_Open`: The ask price at the start of this time interval\n`Ask_High`: The highest ask price during this time interval\n`Ask_Low`: The lowest ask price during this time interval\n`Ask_Close`: The ask price at the end of this time interval\n`Ask_Volume`: The number of times the Ask Price changed within this time interval\n`Class`: Whether the average price will go up during the next interval",
