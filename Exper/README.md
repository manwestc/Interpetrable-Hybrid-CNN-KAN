This folder contains all the experiments, data, and results from my Master's thesis:

> **Interpretable Hybrid Models for Tabular Data: Integrating Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold and Convolutional Networks via Synthetic Images**

based on and extending the [pykan](https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan) repository.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This thesis investigates hybrid modeling architectures that combine KAN networks and CNNs for tabular data transformed into synthetic images. The research addresses the following objectives:

- Replacing traditional MLPs with KAN networks to achieve improved interpretability and competitive performance.
- Integrating CNNs trained on synthetic images to leverage spatial patterns in tabular data.
- Comparing different tabular-to-image transformation methods (IGTD, REFINED, TINTO).
- Introducing the **Global Feature Score** as a unified interpretability metric.
- Evaluating various concatenation strategies between the CNN and KAN branches.
- Exploring branch relevance and feature importance to enhance model interpretability.
